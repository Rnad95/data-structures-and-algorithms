## Introduction

---
This Challenge is created to Implement the zipList method to the LinkedList class.  

> `zipList(Ls1,Ls2)` : to return a new LinkedList contains element from the LinkedList 1 then Element from the LinkedList 2.

## Approach & Efficiency

---
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O of method : O(n)  

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

the steps to run this code in your machine:  

1. Clone the the repo to your local machine.  
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDE
3. Then, create the configuration to the App (New Application) and Test (Junit) As the Figure below Show:

4. Run the project and test it in intelliJ environment  
 `OR`
test the code in terminal:

> `renad@renad-HP-Notebook:~/data-structures-and-algorithms/Challenge08$` ./gradlew test

Example of the output of the code using the methods:
