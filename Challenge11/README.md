# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Introduction

---

- Queue is another data structure which is liner list also. It store the data as the stack but the access started First. The Queue principles depending on (First-In First-out(FIFO)).

## Challenge Summary

---
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
In this challenge, we will create a queue using the two stack data structure (the stack is created by own).

-The pseudoQueue Contains:

`enqueue(value)` which is using to add node using First-in First-out Approach.

`dequeue()` which is using to remove node using First-in First-out Approach.

## Approach & Efficiency

---
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- The complexity of O notation of enqueue is O(N) meanwhile the dequeue is  O(1)

## Solution

The steps to run this code in your machine:  

1. Clone the the repo to your local machine.  
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDE
3. Then, create the configuration to the App (New Application) and Test (Junit) As the Figure below Show:

4. Run the project and test it in intelliJ environment  
 `OR`
test the code in terminal:

> `renad@renad-HP-Notebook:~/data-structures-and-algorithms/Challenge11$` ./gradlew test
